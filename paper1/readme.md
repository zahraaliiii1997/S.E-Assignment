***Introduction:*** Agile development is an increasing trend for software organizations, whether small or large, working co-located or geographically distributed. Still, there are many challenges in supporting effective collaboration and communication for agile teams. This research aims at studying the Agile work environment at Klopotek to identify points of friction between development practices and collaboration tools. As such, we are interested in answering the following research question: How can the Agile work environment be improved to facilitate communication and better support the collaboration workflow?
